# Admin Reports Fix

## Issue

The admin reports page was not showing/working in the Payload admin panel.

## Root Cause

The `payload.config.ts` file referenced a custom admin view component `@/components/AdminReports` that didn't exist:

```typescript
admin: {
  components: {
    views: {
      Reports: {
        Component: '@/components/AdminReports',  // ‚ùå Component didn't exist
        path: '/reports',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Solution

### Created AdminReports Component

**File**: `src/components/AdminReports.tsx` (NEW)

Created a dashboard-style reports page that provides quick access to all admin reporting features:

#### Features:

1. **Quick Navigation Cards** - Links to key collections:
   - Orders (sales reports)
   - Product Reports (reported products)
   - Reviews (customer reviews)
   - Users (customer management)
   - Products (inventory)
   - Contact Submissions (inquiries)

2. **Visual Design**:
   - Card-based layout with icons
   - Color-coded by category
   - Hover effects for better UX
   - Responsive grid layout

3. **Quick Stats Section**:
   - Placeholder for key metrics
   - Links to detailed views
