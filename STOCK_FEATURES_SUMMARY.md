# Stock Management Features - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Payload Admin - Visual Stock Indicators**

**File**: `src/components/StockField.tsx`

A custom field component that displays:

- üî¥ **OUT OF STOCK** badge (red) when stock = 0
- üü† **LOW STOCK** badge (orange) when stock ‚â§ threshold
- üü¢ **IN STOCK** badge (green) when stock > threshold
- Real-time unit count display

**Changes to Products Collection** (`src/collections/Products/index.ts`):

- Added custom field component for stock visualization
- Auto-updates product status to "out-of-stock" when stock reaches 0
- Auto-restores status to "published" when stock is replenished
- Added searchable fields including SKU

---

### 2. **Product Cards - Stock Badges & Disabled Buttons**

**File**: `src/components/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx`

**Visual Indicators**:

- Red "OUT OF STOCK" badge on product image
- Orange "ONLY X LEFT" badge for low stock items
- Stock status text below product title

**Functionality**:

- Add to Cart button disabled for out-of-stock products
- Button text changes to "Out of Stock"
- Grayed out appearance when unavailable
- Prevents clicking on out-of-stock items

---

### 3. **Product Detail Page - Quantity Limits**

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/product/[slug]/page.client.tsx`

**Stock Display**:

- Color-coded status indicators (red/orange/green)
- Shows exact available quantity
- Real-time stock information

**Quantity Controls**:

- Plus button disabled when max stock reached
- "Maximum available" message displayed
- Prevents selecting more than available stock
- Validation before adding to cart

**Purchase Buttons**:

- Both "Buy Now" and "Add to Cart" disabled when out of stock
- Alert messages if trying to purchase unavailable items
- Stock validation on every action

---

### 4. **Shopping Cart - Stock Warnings**

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/cart/page.client.tsx`

**Warnings**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Out of stock" warning for unavailable items
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Only X available" when cart quantity exceeds stock
- Visual indicators next to product names

**Quantity Controls**:

- Plus button disabled when reaching max available stock
- Minus button disabled at quantity 1
- Real-time validation on quantity changes
- Prevents exceeding available inventory

---

### 5. **Checkout - Pre-Order Validation**

**Files**:

- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` (backend validation)
- `src/app/(frontend)/checkout/pageClient.tsx` (error handling)

**Validation Process**:

1. Checks all products still exist
2. Verifies products are not out of stock
3. Confirms requested quantities don't exceed available stock
4. Returns detailed error messages for each issue

**Error Handling**:

- Prevents order creation if validation fails
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Lists all stock issues clearly

---

### 6. **Automatic Stock Deduction**

**File**: `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts`

**Process**:

1. Order is successfully created
2. System loops through all order items
3. Deducts quantity from each product's stock
4. Updates product status to "out-of-stock" if stock reaches 0
5. Only affects products with inventory tracking enabled

**Safety**:

- Stock only deducted after successful order creation
- Atomic operations to prevent race conditions
- Respects `trackInventory` setting

---

### 7. **Stock Restoration on Cancellation**

**File**: `src/collections/Orders.ts`

**Process**:

1. Order status changes to "cancelled"
2. System restores stock for all items in the order
3. Updates product status from "out-of-stock" to "published" if applicable
4. Logs restoration activity for audit trail

**Features**:

- Automatic restoration hook
- Handles partial cancellations
- Maintains data integrity
- Audit logging
