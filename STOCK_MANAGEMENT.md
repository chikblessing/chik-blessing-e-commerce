  stock: number // Current stock quantity
  trackInventory: boolean // Enable/disable inventory tracking (default: true)
  lowStockThreshold: number // Alert threshold (default: 10)
  sku: string // Stock Keeping Unit
}
```

### Disabling Inventory Tracking

To disable inventory tracking for a product:

1. Edit the product in Payload admin
2. Navigate to Inventory section
3. Uncheck "Track Inventory"
4. Product will be treated as always available

## Stock Flow

### Purchase Flow

1. Customer adds item to cart ‚Üí Validates current stock
2. Customer proceeds to checkout ‚Üí Re-validates all items
3. Order is created ‚Üí Stock is deducted
4. If stock reaches 0 ‚Üí Product status changes to "out-of-stock"

### Cancellation Flow

1. Admin/System cancels order
2. System restores stock for all items
3. If product was out-of-stock ‚Üí Status changes back to "published"
4. Stock restoration is logged

## API Endpoints

### Stock Validation (Checkout)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/checkout`

**Validation Checks**:

- Product exists
- Product is not out of stock
- Requested quantity ‚â§ available stock

**Error Response**:

```json
{
  "error": "Stock validation failed",
  "details": [
    "Only 5 units of \"Product Name\" available (requested 10)",
    "\"Another Product\" is out of stock"
  ]
}
```
