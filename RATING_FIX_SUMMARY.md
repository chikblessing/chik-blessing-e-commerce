# Product Rating Display Fix

## Issue

The average rating on product detail pages was not reflecting/updating after new reviews were submitted.

## Root Cause

The product rating was being read from the initial product prop but wasn't being updated when new reviews were added. The `handleReviewSubmitted` function only refreshed the reviews list but didn't update the product rating data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Product Rating State**

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/product/[slug]/page.client.tsx`

Created a new state to track the product rating separately:

```typescript
const [productRating, setProductRating] = useState({
  average: product.rating?.average || 0,
  count: product.rating?.count || 0,
  breakdown: product.rating?.breakdown || {
    fiveStars: 0,
    fourStars: 0,
    threeStars: 0,
    twoStars: 0,
    oneStar: 0,
  },
})
```

### 2. **Updated handleReviewSubmitted Function**

Enhanced the function to fetch both updated reviews AND updated product data:

```typescript
const handleReviewSubmitted = async () => {
  setShowReviewForm(false)
  try {
    // Fetch updated reviews
    const reviewsResponse = await fetch(`/api/products/${product.id}/reviews`)
    if (reviewsResponse.ok) {
      const reviewsData = await reviewsResponse.json()
      setReviews(reviewsData.reviews)
    }

    // Fetch updated product to get new rating
    const productResponse = await fetch(`/api/products/${product.id}`)
    if (productResponse.ok) {
      const productData = await productResponse.json()
      if (productData.rating) {
        setProductRating({
          average: productData.rating.average || 0,
          count: productData.rating.count || 0,
          breakdown: productData.rating.breakdown || { ... },
        })
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error refreshing reviews:', error)
  }
}
```

### 3. **Updated Rating Display Components**

Changed all rating displays to use the state instead of the prop:

**StarRating Component**:

```typescript
<StarRating
  rating={Math.round(productRating.average)}
  count={productRating.count}
/>
```

**ReviewSummary Component**:

```typescript
{activeTab === 'reviews' && productRating.count > 0 ? (
  <ReviewSummary
    average={productRating.average}
    count={productRating.count}
    breakdown={productRating.breakdown}
  />
) : ( ... )}
```

### 4. **Created Product API Endpoint**

**File**: `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` (NEW)

Created a new API endpoint to fetch a single product by ID:

```typescript
export async function GET(request, { params }) {
  const { id } = await params
  const payload = await getPayload({ config: configPromise })

  const product = await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'products',
    id,
    depth: 1,
  })

  return NextResponse.json(product)
}
```

## How It Works

### Flow:

1. User submits a review
2. Review is created in database
3. `afterChange` hook in Reviews collection triggers `updateProductRating()`
4. Product rating is recalculated and updated in database
5. Frontend `handleReviewSubmitted` function:
   - Fetches updated reviews list
   - Fetches updated product data (including new rating)
   - Updates local state with new rating
6. UI re-renders with updated rating

### Before vs After:

**Before**:

```
User submits review â†’ Review saved â†’ Reviews list updates
                                   â†“
                          Rating stays the same (stale)
```

**After**:

```
User submits review â†’ Review saved â†’ Reviews list updates
                                   â†“
                          Product rating recalculated in DB
                                   â†“
                          Frontend fetches new rating
                                   â†“
                          UI updates with new rating âœ“
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Rating updates immediately after review submission
âœ… **Accurate Display**: Always shows the current rating from database
âœ… **Better UX**: Users see their review impact instantly
âœ… **No Page Reload**: Updates happen without full page refresh
âœ… **Consistent Data**: Rating matches the actual reviews displayed

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/(frontend)/product/[slug]/page.client.tsx`**
   - Added `productRating` state
   - Updated `handleReviewSubmitted` to fetch product data
   - Changed rating displays to use state

2. **`src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`** (NEW)
   - Created endpoint to fetch single product by ID

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Initial page load shows correct rating
- [ ] Submit a review and verify rating updates
- [ ] Rating count increases by 1
- [ ] Average rating recalculates correctly
- [ ] Star display updates to match new average
- [ ] ReviewSummary breakdown updates
- [ ] No page reload required
- [ ] Works for first review (0 â†’ 1)
- [ ] Works for multiple reviews

## Technical Notes

### Why State Instead of Router.refresh()?

- **State approach**: Faster, no full page reload, better UX
- **Router.refresh()**: Slower, reloads entire page, worse UX
- State allows granular updates of just the rating data

### Rating Calculation

The rating is calculated in the `updateProductRating` function in `src/collections/Reviews.ts`:

- Fetches all reviews for the product
- Calculates average from all ratings
- Counts breakdown by star rating (1-5)
- Updates product document in database

### API Endpoint Design

The `/api/products/[id]` endpoint:

- Accepts product ID as URL parameter
- Returns full product document
- Includes rating data
- Used for real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- WebSocket for real-time updates across all users
- Optimistic UI updates (show rating before API confirms)
- Caching strategy for product data
- Rate limiting on review submissions
- Review moderation queue
