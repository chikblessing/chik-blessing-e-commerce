# Review System Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a complete review system for products with the following features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Review Collection (Already Existed)

- Located at `src/collections/Reviews.ts`
- Fields: product, customer, title, comment, rating (1-5), status, isVerifiedPurchase
- Automatic rating calculation and product rating updates via hooks
- Verified purchase detection based on order history

### 2. Review Components (Already Existed)

- **ReviewSummary**: Displays average rating, total count, and rating breakdown
- **ReviewList**: Shows all approved reviews with customer info and verified purchase badges
- **ReviewForm**: Allows logged-in users to submit reviews

### 3. API Route (NEW)

- **POST /api/reviews**: Creates new reviews
- Validates required fields and rating range
- Prevents duplicate reviews from same user
- Sets initial status to 'pending' for admin approval

### 4. Product Page Integration (UPDATED)
