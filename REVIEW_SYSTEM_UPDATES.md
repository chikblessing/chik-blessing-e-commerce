# Review System Updates

## Overview

The review system has been updated to ensure only verified purchasers can leave reviews, and to remove the approval workflow (admins can only delete inappropriate reviews).

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Purchase Verification Required**

**File**: `src/collections/Reviews.ts`

**Before**: Any authenticated user could review any product
**After**: Only users who have purchased the product can leave a review

**Validation Logic**:

- Checks if user has an order containing the product
- Order must be in one of these states:
  - `delivered` - Order has been delivered
  - `shipped` - Order is on the way
  - `paid` - Payment confirmed (for pickup orders)
- Prevents review creation if user hasn't purchased the product
- Error message: "You can only review products you have purchased"

---

### 2. **One Review Per Product Per User**

**Before**: Users could potentially submit multiple reviews
**After**: Each user can only review a product once

**Validation**:

- Checks for existing reviews from the same user for the same product
- Prevents duplicate review creation
- Error message: "You have already reviewed this product"

---

### 3. **Removed Approval Workflow**

**Before**: Reviews had status field (pending/approved/rejected) requiring admin approval
**After**: All reviews are automatically published

**Changes**:

- Removed `status` field from Reviews collection
- Reviews appear immediately after submission
- No admin approval needed
- Simplified workflow for better user experience

---

### 4. **Admin Can Delete Reviews**

**Access Control**:

- **Create**: Only authenticated users (with purchase verification)
- **Read**: Public (anyone can read reviews)
- **Update**: Admins and review authors can edit
- **Delete**: Only admins and super admins can delete

**Purpose**: Allows admins to remove inappropriate or spam reviews

---

### 5. **Verified Purchase Badge**

**Feature**: All reviews automatically show "Verified Purchase" badge
**Logic**: Since only purchasers can review, all reviews are verified
**Display**: Green badge with checkmark icon in ReviewList component

---

## 📊 Review Flow

### Old Flow:

```
User submits review → Status: Pending → Admin approves → Review visible
```

### New Flow:

```
User purchases product → User submits review → Review visible immediately
                                              ↓
                                    Admin can delete if inappropriate
```

### Protection Against:

- ✅ Fake reviews (purchase verification)
- ✅ Review spam (one review per product)
- ✅ Unauthorized deletion (admin-only)
- ✅ Manipulation (server-side validation)
